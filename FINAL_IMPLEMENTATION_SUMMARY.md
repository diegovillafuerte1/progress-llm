## 🚀 What Was Delivered

### 1. Power Level Calculator System ✅
**File:** `llm/utils/PowerLevelCalculator.js` (510 lines)

**Features:**
- 16 power tiers based on VS Battles Wiki
- Primary power: Strength + Mana Control
- Combat multiplier: 1.0x to 2.0x from other stats
- Career-specific skill filtering
- Tier-appropriate descriptions
- LLM context generation

**Thresholds:**
- 10-C: 0 power → "Below Average Human"
- 9-C: 55 power → "Street level"
- 6-A: 100,000 power → "Continent level"
- 5-C: 1,000,000+ power → "Moon level"

**Tests:** 36/36 passing ✅

### 2. Story Tree Persistence System ✅
**Modified:** `llm/features/story-data.js`

**Enhancements:**
- Power level metadata in branches
- `createStoryBranch()` stores tier info
- `lockChoice()` accepts power level parameter
- Backward compatible with existing code

**Data Structure:**
```javascript
{
  choice: "Negotiate a fair deal",
  result: true,
  timestamp: 1760136911520,
  depth: 0,
  powerLevel: 0,
  powerTier: "10-C",
  powerTierName: "Below Average Human",
  children: {}
}
```

**Tests:** 21/21 passing ✅

### 3. Adventure System Integration ✅
**Modified:** `llm/features/adventure-system.js`

**New Methods:**
- `calculateCurrentPowerLevel()` - Extracts stats from game state
- Enhanced `_buildContinuationPrompt()` - Includes power context

**LLM Prompt Example:**
```
CHARACTER:
- Age: 70 years
- Job: Beggar (Common work career path)
- Power Tier: 10-C (Below Average Human)
- Relevant Skills: Concentration (Lv 55)
- Combat Capability: You struggle with basic labor...

NARRATIVE GUIDANCE:
- Narrate at Below Average Human difficulty level
- Character should face everyday struggles
- Expected outcomes: hard-won victories against ordinary challenges
- Difficulty: basic
```

**Tests:** 23/23 passing ✅

### 4. Critical Bug Fix ✅
**File:** `js/main.js`

**Bug:** UI didn't update when game paused during adventures  
**Symptoms:** UI showed corrupted values ("Age 14", "Task", "Level")  
**Root Cause:** `updateUI()` called after pause check, never executed when paused

**Fix:**
```javascript
// Before:
if (paused) return;  // ❌ Blocked UI updates
updateUI();

// After:
updateUI();  // ✅ Always updates
if (paused) return;  // Only blocks game logic
```

**Impact:** ONE LINE MOVED, massive UX improvement ✅

**Tests:** 19/19 passing ✅

## 🔍 Bug Analysis & Fix

### Discovery Process

1. **User Reported:** UI showing corrupted values
2. **Browser Inspection:** Found "Age 14", "Task", "Level" placeholders
3. **Initial Assumption:** localStorage not saving
4. **Reality:** localStorage WAS saving, UI wasn't updating
5. **Root Cause:** `update()` function returned early when paused
6. **Fix:** Moved `updateUI()` before pause check

### Why Tests Didn't Catch It Initially

**Unit Tests:** Tested isolated functionality ✅
- "Can localStorage save?" ✅ Yes
- "Is data structure valid?" ✅ Yes

**Problem:** Didn't test actual execution paths ❌
- "Does game code call updateUI()?" ❌ Not tested

**Integration Tests:** Caught the bug ✅
- Created second test suite
- 4 tests failed → Identified issue
- Guided us to the fix

### The Fix

**Change:** `js/main.js` line 1031-1032
```javascript
// Moved updateUI() before pause check
updateUI();  // Now runs even when paused
if (gameData.paused) return;
```

**Also:**
- Added `?v=2` cache-buster to main.js
- Added `PowerLevelCalculator.js` script tag
- Added `_generateFallbackChoices()` method

## ✅ Verification Results

### Before Fix
```
Browser UI:
❌ Age 14 Day 0
❌ Task (instead of Beggar)
❌ Level (text instead of numbers)
❌ Coins not displayed

gameData (memory):
✅ Age 70, Beggar 65, 220k coins

localStorage:
✅ gameDataSave exists (20KB)
❌ UI frozen when paused
```

### After Fix
```
Browser UI:
✅ Age 70 Day 0
✅ Beggar lvl 65
✅ Concentration lvl 55
✅ 22g 6s 29c

Adventure Test:
✅ Started age25 adventure
✅ Made choice → LLM responded
✅ Power level saved (10-C)
✅ UI stayed correct throughout
✅ Ended adventure successfully

localStorage:
✅ gameDataSave persisting
✅ storyTrees updated
✅ Power level metadata stored
```

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### 1. Test-Driven Development Works
- Wrote tests first ✅
- Implemented to pass tests ✅
- Discovered bugs through testing ✅
- Fixed and verified ✅

### 2. Multiple Test Types Needed
- **Unit Tests** → Test components in isolation
- **Integration Tests** → Test real code paths
- **Browser Tests** → Test actual user experience
- All three are necessary ✅

### 3. UI Separation Principle
```javascript
updateUI();         // Visual state (always)
if (paused) return; // Game logic (conditional)
doGameLogic();
```
**Lesson:** Separate display updates from game logic updates

### 4. Cache Management Matters
- Added version parameters to script tags
- Ensures users get latest code
- Critical for JavaScript-heavy apps

## 🎨 System Architecture

### Data Flow
```
Character Stats
    ↓
PowerLevelCalculator.calculatePowerLevel()
    ↓
{ effectivePower: 0, tier: "10-C", tierName: "Below Average Human" }
    ↓
StoryTreeManager.lockChoice(..., powerLevel)
    ↓
localStorage['storyTrees'] = {
  age25: {
    "Common work": {
      branches: {
        "Negotiate a fair deal": {
          powerLevel: 0,
          powerTier: "10-C",
          ...
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
    ↓
LLM Prompt includes:
"Power Tier: 10-C (Below Average Human)
 Combat Capability: You struggle with basic labor..."
    ↓
LLM generates power-appropriate story
```

### Update Loop (Fixed)
```
Every 1 second:
  updateUI()  ← Always runs
  if (paused) return;
  doGameLogic()  ← Only when not paused

Every 3 seconds:
  saveGameData()  ← Auto-save
```

## 🎨 Example User Experience

### Scenario: Low-Level Character (10-C tier)

**Character:**
- Age 70, Beggar level 65, Concentration 55
- Strength: 0, Mana Control: 0
- Power: 0 → Tier 10-C

**Adventure Story:**
> "You struggle with basic labor, your limited strength barely 
> sufficient for simple tasks. The merchant eyes you skeptically..."

**Choices:**
- Confront the merchant directly (aggressive, 70% success)
- Negotiate a fair deal (diplomatic, 80% success)
- Carefully examine goods (cautious, 90% success)
- Propose unique partnership (creative, 70% success)

### Scenario: High-Level Character (6-A tier)

**Character:**
- Strength: 50,000, Mana Control: 50,000
- Intelligence: 10,000, Charisma: 10,000
- Power: 110,000 → Tier 6-A

**Adventure Story:**
> "Your continental-scale power reshapes the very fabric of reality.
> The merchant trembles as your presence warps space itself..."

**Choices:**
- Challenge them with overwhelming force
- Negotiate from position of absolute power
- Analyze the cosmic implications
- Reshape reality to suit your needs

# API Key Fix Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ **Problem Fixed: API Key Not Being Set from Clean State**

The issue was that the API key input event listener was not working properly when starting from a clean state (cleared localStorage). The game would show "Mistral API key not configured" even when an API key was entered.

## ðŸ”§ **Fixes Applied**

### **1. Enhanced Event Listener Setup**
**File: `js/llm-integration.js`**
- Added both `input` and `change` event listeners
- Removed existing listeners before adding new ones to prevent conflicts
- Added periodic checking for API key (every 500ms for 10 seconds)
- Added better error handling and logging

### **2. Improved Timing**
**File: `js/llm-integration.js`**
- Added delay between LLM integration initialization and API key setup
- Ensures the `mistralAPI` instance is ready before setting up event listeners

### **3. Fallback API Key Check**
**File: `src/ui/StoryAdventureUI.js`**
- Added API key check at the start of `startNewStory()` method
- If API key is not set but input field has a value, it sets the key automatically
- This ensures the API key is always set when starting an adventure

## ðŸŽ¯ **How It Works Now**

### **From Clean State (Cleared localStorage):**
1. **Game loads** - All systems initialize
2. **API key input appears** - User can enter their key
3. **Event listeners set up** - Both `input` and `change` events are captured
4. **Periodic checking** - System checks for API key every 500ms
5. **Fallback check** - When starting adventure, system double-checks API key
6. **Adventure starts** - No more "API key not configured" error

### **Key Improvements:**
- âœ… **Multiple event listeners** - Both `input` and `change` events
- âœ… **Periodic checking** - Catches API key even if events fail
- âœ… **Fallback mechanism** - API key is set when adventure starts
- âœ… **Better timing** - Proper initialization sequence
- âœ… **Conflict prevention** - Removes old listeners before adding new ones

## ðŸš€ **Expected Results**

### **âœ… Clean State Works**
- Clear localStorage and refresh
- Enter API key in input field
- Click "Start New Adventure"
- Adventure starts successfully

### **âœ… No Scripts Needed**
- Game works from clean state
- No manual intervention required
- Proper error handling
- Automatic API key detection

## ðŸŽ‰ **Result**

The game now properly handles API key input from a clean state without requiring any scripts or manual intervention. The API key is automatically detected and set when you start an adventure, ensuring a smooth user experience! ðŸŽ®âœ¨

# Power Level & Story Tree Implementation - Complete Summary

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All Tests Passing (80/80)

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive power level tiering system integrated with story tree persistence and LLM narrative generation. This system ensures that:
1. Character power levels are calculated based on stats using VS Battles Wiki tiers
2. Story trees persist across rebirths with power level metadata
3. LLM prompts include power level context for appropriate story scaling
4. Visited story paths return consistent content, while new paths generate fresh content

## Implementation Summary

### ✅ Phase 1: Power Level Calculator (COMPLETE)

**File Created:** `llm/utils/PowerLevelCalculator.js`

**Features Implemented:**
- **Tier Calculation System**: 16 power tiers from 10-C (Below Average Human) to 5-C (Moon level)
- **Primary Power**: Sum of Strength + Mana Control
- **Combat Multiplier**: Additional stats (Intelligence, Charisma, etc.) provide 1.0x to 2.0x multiplier
- **Tier Thresholds**: 
  - 10-C: 0 power (Starting character)
  - 9-C: 55 power (Street level)
  - 6-A: 100,000 power (Continent level)
  - 5-C: 1,000,000+ power (Moon level - requires multipliers)

**Methods:**
- `calculatePowerLevel(stats)` - Complete power calculation
- `getPowerTier(effectivePower)` - Maps power to tier
- `getCareerRelevantSkills(characterState, career)` - Filters top skills
- `getCombatCapabilityDescription(tier, career)` - Career-specific descriptions
- `generateLLMContext(powerLevel, career)` - LLM-ready context string
- `getNarrativeGuidance(tier, career)` - Difficulty scaling info
- `buildFullPromptContext(...)` - Complete LLM prompt section

**Test Coverage:** 36 tests in `tests/llm/power-level-calculator.test.js`
- Tier calculation for all thresholds
- Combat multiplier calculations
- Career-relevant skill extraction
- Combat capability descriptions
- Integration scenarios

### ✅ Phase 2: Story Tree Enhancement (COMPLETE)

**File Modified:** `llm/features/story-data.js`

**Changes:**
1. **StoryTreeData.createStoryBranch()** - Now accepts `powerLevel` parameter
   - Stores: `powerLevel`, `powerTier`, `powerTierName`
   - Maintains backward compatibility with `null` default

2. **StoryTreeManager.lockChoice()** - Enhanced signature
   - Now accepts optional `powerLevel` parameter
   - Stores power level metadata with each choice

3. **StoryTreeBuilder.addChoice()** - Updated signature
   - Passes power level through to storage layer

**Data Structure:**
```javascript
{
  choice: "Attack the dragon",
  result: true,
  timestamp: 1234567890,
  depth: 0,
  powerLevel: 5075,
  powerTier: "7-C",
  powerTierName: "Town level",
  children: {}
}
```

**Test Coverage:** 21 tests in `tests/llm/rebirth-story-consistency.test.js`
- localStorage persistence
- Visited vs unvisited leaf detection
- Success/failure/success/failure/failure pattern
- Three consecutive failures (auto-end)
- Three consecutive successes (manual end)
- New path differentiation
- Cross-life story comparison
- Complete rebirth cycle integration

### ✅ Phase 3: Adventure System Integration (COMPLETE)

**File Modified:** `llm/features/adventure-system.js`

**New Methods:**
1. **calculateCurrentPowerLevel()** - Extracts stats from game state
   - Maps taskData keys to power stats
   - Uses PowerLevelCalculator when available
   - Provides fallback for safety

2. **Enhanced _buildContinuationPrompt()** - Includes power context
   - Calculates current power level
   - Uses `PowerLevelCalculator.buildFullPromptContext()` when available
   - Provides detailed character capabilities to LLM
   - Adapts narrative guidance based on tier

**Integration Points:**
- `handleCareerBasedChoice()` now calculates and stores power level
- Story continuations include power-appropriate challenges
- LLM receives full context: tier, skills, combat capabilities, narrative guidance

**LLM Prompt Enhancement:**
```
CHARACTER:
- Age: 25 years
- Job: Wizard (The Arcane career path)
- Power Tier: 7-B (City level)
- Relevant Skills: Magic (Lv 50), Intelligence (Lv 30)
- Combat Capability: Your spells can alter weather patterns and reshape geography.
- Current situation: age25 amulet milestone

NARRATIVE GUIDANCE:
- Narrate at City level difficulty level
- Character should face civilization-threatening dangers
- Expected outcomes: legendary triumphs that reshape regions
- Difficulty: epic
```

**Test Coverage:** 23 tests in `tests/llm/llm-context-power-level.test.js`
- Power level context generation for all tiers
- Narrative guidance adaptation
- Full prompt context construction
- Career-specific context variations
- Difficulty scaling verification
- Context consistency checks

## Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. Power Tier Progression Examples

**Beginner (10-C - 0 power):**
```
"You struggle with basic labor, your limited strength 
barely sufficient for simple tasks."
```

**Mid-Level (7-B - 10,000 power):**
```
"Cities fortify their defenses when you march to war."
```

**High-Level (6-A - 100,000 power):**
```
"Your continental-scale power reshapes the very fabric of reality, 
few can stand before you."
```

**Legendary (5-C - 1,000,000+ power):**
```
"Your power rivals celestial bodies, threatening the very planet."
```

### 2. Rebirth Story Consistency

**Scenario: Life 1 → Death → Life 2**

**Life 1 (Level 10 character):**
- Makes choice "Attack the dragon"
- Story generated: "Your novice sword barely scratches its scales..."
- Result stored with power level 55 (9-C tier)

**Life 2 (Level 100 character):**
- Selects same choice "Attack the dragon"
- Story retrieved: "Your novice sword barely scratches its scales..." (SAME)
- Power level 10,000 (7-B tier) is NOT used for this path

**Life 2 (New path):**
- Selects different choice "Negotiate with dragon"
- Story generated: "Your legendary diplomatic prowess..." (NEW)
- Uses current power level 10,000 (7-B tier)

### 3. Power-Based Story Differentiation

The system ensures the LLM receives context that influences story generation:

**Low Power (10-C):**
- Difficulty: "basic"
- Challenges: "everyday struggles"
- Outcomes: "hard-won victories against ordinary challenges"

**High Power (6-A):**
- Difficulty: "legendary"
- Challenges: "continental or world-scale threats"
- Outcomes: "godlike achievements that alter the world"

## Architecture Benefits

- **StoryTreeManager**: Storage and retrieval
- **AdventureSystem**: Coordination and LLM integration

### 2. Backward Compatibility

## Usage Guide

### For Developers

**Calculating Power Level:**
```javascript
const stats = {
  Strength: 5000,
  ManaControl: 5000,
  Intelligence: 1000,
  Charisma: 1000
};

const powerLevel = PowerLevelCalculator.calculatePowerLevel(stats);
// Returns: { effectivePower: 22000, tier: '7-B', tierName: 'City level', ... }
```

**Storing Choice with Power Level:**
```javascript
const powerLevel = this.calculateCurrentPowerLevel();
storyTreeBuilder.addChoice(
  'age25',
  'Military',
  'Charge into battle',
  true,
  powerLevel
);
```

**Generating LLM Context:**
```javascript
const context = PowerLevelCalculator.buildFullPromptContext(
  characterState,
  powerLevel,
  'Military',
  'age25'
);
// Returns: Multi-line context string ready for LLM prompt
```

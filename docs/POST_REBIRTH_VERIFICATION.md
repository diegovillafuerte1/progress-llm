+179 days| 25 Day 283| Lvl 36 | Lvl 26       | 67s 74c
```

✅ **UI updated continuously and correctly throughout**

### 2. Story Tree Persistence ✅

**Verified localStorage Contents:**
```javascript
{
  age25: {
    "Common work": {

        "Create a unique marketing strategy...",
        "Carefully examine the merchant's goods"
      ],
      branches: {
        "Negotiate a fair deal": {
          powerLevel: 0,
          powerTier: "10-C",
          powerTierName: "Below Average Human",
          result: true,
          timestamp: 1760137428152
        }
      }
    }
  },
  age65: {
    "Common work": {
      choices: ["Negotiate a fair deal"],
      // ... (from previous life)
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. UI Update Bug Fix Verification ✅

**Critical Test: UI During Paused State**

**Before Fix (What Would Have Happened):**
```
Adventure starts → Game pauses → updateUI() skipped
UI shows: "Age 14", "Task", "Level", no coins
```

**After Fix (What Actually Happened):**
```
Adventure starts → Game pauses → updateUI() STILL runs
UI shows: "Age 25 Day 283", "Beggar lvl 36", "67s 74c"
✅ UI remained accurate throughout entire adventure!
```

**Verification Points:**
- ✅ UI updated while adventure active
- ✅ Age displayed correctly (25, not 14)
- ✅ Job displayed correctly (Beggar lvl 36, not "Task")
- ✅ Coins displayed correctly (67s 74c, not hidden)
- ✅ Levels showed numbers (36, 26), not text ("Level")

### 5. Power Level Integration ✅

**Current Character Stats:**
```javascript
{
  Strength: 0,
  ManaControl: 0,
  Intelligence: 0,
  Charisma: 0
}
```

**Power Calculation:**
- Primary Power: 0 + 0 = 0
- Combat Multiplier: 1.0 (no combat stats)
- Effective Power: 0
- **Tier: 10-C** ✅
- **Tier Name: "Below Average Human"** ✅

**Stored in Story Tree:**
```javascript
{
  powerLevel: 0,
  powerTier: "10-C",
  powerTierName: "Below Average Human"
}
```

✅ **Power level calculated and stored correctly!**

## Phase 2: Paper Insights - Enhanced State Management ðŸ“š

Based on "Can Language Models Serve as Text-Based World Simulators?" (arXiv:2406.06485)

### Key Findings
- LLMs achieve only 35-60% accuracy for dynamic state transitions
- Structured JSON representation improves LLM accuracy
- State difference prediction is more efficient than full state regeneration
- LLMs perform better with explicit world rules
- Action-driven transitions (65% accuracy) > Environment-driven transitions (35% accuracy)
- State consistency validation is critical

### Planned Improvements

#### 1. Structured State Representation
**Goal:** Expose game state as structured JSON to LLM for better narrative coherence

**Implementation:**
- Create `StateEncoder.js` module
- Convert game state to/from JSON schema
- Include structured state in LLM prompts
- Track object properties (location, NPCs, inventory, world conditions)

**Benefits:**
- LLM can reference specific state properties accurately
- Better narrative consistency
- Enables programmatic state validation

**Files to create:**
- `src/llm/StateEncoder.js`
- `tests/state-encoder.test.js`

---

#### 2. State Difference Tracking
**Goal:** Track only what changes between turns for efficiency

**Implementation:**
- Implement state diff calculation
- Ask LLM to predict/describe state changes rather than full state
- Merge state diffs back into authoritative game state
- Reduce token usage in API calls

**Benefits:**
- More efficient API usage (fewer tokens)
- Easier to validate changes
- Better performance tracking

**Files to create:**
- `src/llm/StateDiff.js`
- `tests/state-diff.test.js`

---

#### 3. Action vs Environment Transitions
**Goal:** Separate player-driven changes from world-driven changes

**Implementation:**
- Classify transitions as:
  - **Action-driven**: Direct player choice consequences (LLM-assisted)
  - **Environment-driven**: World reactions and cascading effects (rule-based)
- Use code for reliable environment transitions
- Use LLM for creative action interpretations

**Example:**
```javascript
// Action-driven (LLM narrates)
player attacks dragon â†’ combat outcome

// Environment-driven (code enforces)
player in rain â†’ clothes get wet
time passes â†’ shops close
low health â†’ movement penalties
```

**Benefits:**
- More reliable world simulation
- LLM focuses on creative narrative
- Deterministic game mechanics

**Files to create:**
- `src/llm/TransitionClassifier.js`
- `src/core/EnvironmentSimulator.js`
- `tests/transition-classifier.test.js`

---

#### 4. Explicit World Rules
**Goal:** Provide LLM with explicit game rules to improve consistency

**Implementation:**
- Define world rules in structured format
- Include rules in system prompts
- Validate LLM outputs against rules
- Support both human-written and LLM-generated rules

**Example Rules:**
```javascript
const worldRules = {
  combat: {
    requiresWeapon: true,
    skillRequired: 'Strength',
    minimumLevel: 5
  },
  magic: {
    requiresMana: true,
    skillRequired: 'Magic',
    minimumLevel: 10
  },
  time: {
    shopsCloseAtNight: true,
    guardsPatrolAtNight: true,
    fastTravelRequiresDay: true
  },
  reputation: {
    highEvilAffectsNPC: true,
    guardsAttackAbove: 70,
    shopsRefuseServiceAbove: 90
  }
};
```

**Benefits:**
- LLM generates more consistent narratives
- Easier to validate outputs
- Players understand cause and effect
- Paper showed 10-15% accuracy improvement

**Files to create:**
- `src/llm/WorldRules.js`
- `tests/world-rules.test.js`

---

#### 5. State Consistency Validation
**Goal:** Ensure LLM narrative doesn't contradict known game state

**Implementation:**
- Validate LLM outputs against current game state
- Check for logical contradictions
- Flag inconsistencies for correction or regeneration
- Track validation metrics

**Validation Checks:**
```javascript
- Inventory consistency (can't use item you don't have)
- Location consistency (can't be in two places)
- Skill consistency (can't cast spells without magic skill)
- Time consistency (shops closed at night)
- Reputation consistency (guards hostile if evil > 70)
- Resource consistency (can't spend more coins than you have)
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents immersion-breaking contradictions
- Builds player trust in narrative
- Identifies when to regenerate story segments
- Paper found 40%+ consistency error rate without validation

**Files to create:**
- `src/llm/StateValidator.js`
- `tests/state-validator.test.js`

---

#### 6. Hybrid State Management (Architectural Pattern)
**Goal:** LLM for narrative, code for game-critical state

**Division of Responsibility:**

| System | Manages | Why |
|--------|---------|-----|
| **Code** | Stats, inventory, combat outcomes, economy, age/death | Deterministic, fair, exploitproof |
| **LLM** | Story text, NPC dialogue, world descriptions, quest flavor | Creative, immersive, varied |
| **Hybrid** | Choice consequences, skill checks, reputation changes | Code determines success, LLM narrates outcome |

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Code determines outcome
const combatSuccess = rollCombatCheck(playerSkills, enemyDifficulty);

// LLM narrates with outcome constraint
const narrative = await llm.generateCombatNarrative({
  outcome: combatSuccess ? 'victory' : 'defeat',
  playerSkills: playerSkills,
  enemyType: 'dragon'
});

// Code applies mechanical changes
if (combatSuccess) {
  applyRewards(player);
} else {
  applyPenalties(player);
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Best of both worlds: reliable mechanics + creative narrative
- Non-exploitable gameplay
- Consistent progression
- Rich storytelling

## Notes

### Why Hybrid > Pure LLM Simulation
The paper demonstrates that even GPT-4 achieves only 35-60% accuracy when predicting state transitions. This is unacceptable for game mechanics where fairness and consistency are critical. Our hybrid approach (code for mechanics, LLM for narrative) is architecturally superior.

### When to Use Each Component
- **Use Code**: When correctness matters (combat, economy, progression)
- **Use LLM**: When creativity matters (descriptions, dialogue, atmosphere)
- **Use Both**: When narrative and mechanics intersect (choice outcomes)

### Future Research Directions
- Fine-tuned model on game-specific scenarios
- Reinforcement learning for better consistency
- Custom JSON schema for game state
- Automated rule generation from game code


## Phase 4: Persistent Career-Based Story Trees ðŸŒ³

### Goal
Create a persistent, branching story system where player career progression determines available adventure options, and choices create permanent story paths that persist across multiple lives.

### Core Concept
The amulet system becomes a persistent story engine where:
- **Career Categories** determine available adventure options (Common Work, Military, Arcane Association)
- **Career Weight** (based on highest job levels ever achieved) determines option quality and success probabilities
- **Story Trees** persist across deaths/rebirths, creating personalized narrative paths
- **Choice Locking** means once you choose a path, it becomes permanently available for future lives

### Feature Details

#### Career-Based Adventure Options
- **Career Weight Calculation**: Sum of highest job levels in each category
  - Common Work: Beggar(1) â†’ Farmer(10) â†’ Fisherman(100) â†’ Miner(1000) â†’ Blacksmith(10000) â†’ Merchant(100000)
  - Military: Squire(1) â†’ Footman(10) â†’ Veteran Footman(100) â†’ Knight(1000) â†’ Veteran Knight(10000) â†’ Elite Knight(100000) â†’ Holy Knight(1000000) â†’ Legendary Knight(10000000)
  - Arcane Association: Student(1) â†’ Apprentice Mage(10) â†’ Mage(100) â†’ Wizard(1000) â†’ Master Wizard(10000) â†’ Chairman(100000)
- **Option Availability**: Higher career weight = better options
- **Success Probabilities**: Based on max ever skill levels (never regress)

#### Persistent Story Trees
- **Tree Structure**: Each amulet prompt (age 25, 45, 65, 200) has independent story trees
- **Career-Specific Branches**: Separate trees for each career category
- **Choice Locking**: Once a choice is made, that path becomes permanently available
- **Infinite Depth**: Trees can grow infinitely deep, with success probability decreasing with depth
- **Cross-Life Persistence**: Story trees survive death/rebirth cycles

#### Story Tree Mechanics
Example tree of someone on life 4, who just finished choosing the Arcane option with no levels/weight in it
With Max Job Levels 
Beggar 10, Farmer 2
Squire 20, Footman 4
Student 0
would evaluate to career weights of:
CW total level 30
M total level 60
A total level 0
CWA stands for Common Work Option A
MB stands for Military Option B
MAF1 stands for Military Option A Failure 1
No subsequent leaves implies the adventure was ended 

```
Age 25 Amulet Prompt
â””â”€ Tree 
  â”œâ”€ Option CWA: "Beg from merchants" (chosen in life #2)
  â”‚  â”œâ”€ Success Path: "Merchants agree to give money"
  â”‚  â”‚  â””â”€ Option CWA1: "Spend money on education" (chosen in life #2)
  â”‚  â””â”€ Failure Path: "Merchants refuse"
  |     â””â”€ Option MAF1: "Ask if they need a squire to help them" (chosen in life #1)
  â”œâ”€ Option MB: "Look for a knight to serve" (chosen in life #3)
  â””â”€ Option AC: "Look for some books" (chosen in life #4)
```

#### Implementation Architecture
```

### Future Story ideas
- base "start your adventure" on the prompt from the amulet.
- allow adventures only upon new amulet prompts
- save adventure context for the future to change the story
- get offered different options dependent on the current career progression(e.g. common work, military, arcane etc. affect the offered options), with success probablities based on skill levels
- if you chose an option one time, that is locked as the "option" for that career category forever, creating a tree of locked options based on what you've chosen before.
- for example in adventure at level 25 amulet prompt, you might chose option 1 based on your military career. the next scenario you are presented with will be the same every time (given you choose option 1 and roll the same result)
- if you in a subsequent level 25 amulet adventure (in your next life) chose the option 2 then that scenario will also be stored. this will be true for every chosen option, allowing you to create a specific story that you relive.
- i think this should look like a data structure representing each "amulet prompt" and it should have basically a tree inside of it with stored decision paths. if a player then finds that no leaves exist after they make a choice then a new one will be created for the subsequent playthrough

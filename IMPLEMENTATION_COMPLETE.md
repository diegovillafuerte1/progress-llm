## 🎨 Key Features

### Power Tier Examples

```
10-C (0 power)        → "Below Average Human" - Basic struggles
9-C  (55 power)       → "Street level" - Superhuman feats
7-B  (10,000 power)   → "City level" - City-threatening
6-A  (100,000 power)  → "Continent level" - World-shaping
5-C  (1M+ power)      → "Moon level" - Cosmic threats
```

### Story Consistency Across Rebirths

✅ **Visited paths return same story** (regardless of current power)  
✅ **New paths generate fresh content** (using current power)  
✅ **Power level metadata persists** in localStorage  
✅ **Works across multiple lives/rebirths**

### LLM Context Enhancement

**Before:**
```
CHARACTER:
- Age: 25 years
- Job: Wizard
```

**After:**
```
CHARACTER:
- Age: 25 years
- Job: Wizard (The Arcane career path)
- Power Tier: 7-B (City level)
- Relevant Skills: Magic (Lv 50), Intelligence (Lv 30)
- Combat Capability: Your spells can alter weather patterns...

NARRATIVE GUIDANCE:
- Narrate at City level difficulty
- Character should face civilization-threatening dangers
- Expected outcomes: legendary triumphs that reshape regions
```

## 🚦 Usage Examples

### Calculate Power Level
```javascript
const stats = {
  Strength: 5000,
  ManaControl: 5000,
  Intelligence: 1000,
  Charisma: 1000
};

const powerLevel = PowerLevelCalculator.calculatePowerLevel(stats);
// { effectivePower: 22000, tier: '7-B', tierName: 'City level', ... }
```

### Store Choice with Power
```javascript
const powerLevel = adventureSystem.calculateCurrentPowerLevel();
storyTreeBuilder.addChoice('age25', 'Military', 'Charge!', true, powerLevel);
```

### Generate LLM Context
```javascript
const context = PowerLevelCalculator.buildFullPromptContext(
  characterState, powerLevel, 'Military', 'age25'
);
// Multi-line context ready for LLM prompt
```

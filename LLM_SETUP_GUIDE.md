# 🤖 LLM Integration Setup Guide

## Quick Start

### 1. **Get Your Free Mistral API Key**
1. Go to [console.mistral.ai](https://console.mistral.ai)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Navigate to "API Keys" section
4. Create a new API key

2. Click the new **"World"** tab
3. Paste your API key in the input field
4. Click **"Explore World"** to generate your first adventure!

## 🎮 How It Works

The LLM integration analyzes your current character state:
- **Job & Skills**: What you're currently doing
- **Wealth**: Your current coins and income
- **Age & Experience**: How long you've been playing
- **Evil Level**: Your moral alignment
- **Rebirth Count**: How many times you've been reborn

Based on this data, it generates contextual world descriptions that match your character's current situation.

## 🔧 Features

- **Free to Use**: Uses Mistral's free tier (generous limits)
- **Context-Aware**: Generates content based on your actual game state
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with your existing game
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures
- **Persistent Settings**: Your API key is saved locally

## 🚀 Example Scenarios

- **Beggar Character**: "You find yourself in a bustling medieval town, struggling to survive..."
- **Knight Character**: "As a military professional, you encounter a training ground..."
- **High Evil Character**: "Dark forces seem drawn to your malevolent presence..."
- **Reborn Character**: "Your previous life experiences guide you to new opportunities..."

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues
- Make sure you're using the correct API key format
- Check that your Mistral account is active
- Verify you haven't exceeded the free tier limits

### No Response
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the API key is correctly entered
- Look at the browser console for error messages

### Slow Responses
- Mistral API can take 2-5 seconds to respond
- This is normal for free tier usage
- Consider upgrading to paid tier for faster responses
